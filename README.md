# Dataset Description
Our dataset describes all of the crimes that were reported in the City of Los Angeles area from 2020 to present. The dataset is currently being updated bi-weekly to be up to date. We obtained our data from [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset), and the specific link to our dataset is [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present). Although our data contains much information about each crime, the notable attributes are the date the crime was reported, when the crime occurred, details about the offender, details about the victim, and different location measures of the crime. Each row in the dataset corresponds to one reported crime identified by a DR_NO or a department report number.

# Questions and Analyses
## Question 1
**What are the trends in average age for drug possession and trespassing crime types in LA in 2020?**

Importance: The trends in average age for drug possession and trespassing crime types from Los Angeles in 2020 provides an understanding of the demographics most involved in these crime types. This provides effective resource allocation, policy forming, and social service assistance. By analyzing trends in the average age of people arrested for drug possession and trespassing, policymakers and law enforcement can better understand if these issues affect specific age groups, such as youth or adults. This information can help with the creation of age-specific prevention and education programs, such as youth outreach programs or adult rehab services. Additionally, this analysis could reveal changes in crime trends over time, which is important for assessing the effectiveness of current policies. The data set used likely includes arrest records from law enforcement, which would provide the correct demographic details to conduct this analysis.

## Question 2
**What is the trend in the quantity of burglaries for the month of december and the forecast for the next 4 months of 2021.**

Importance: This question is significant economically and is important for public safety planning, as understanding seasonal trends and forecasting future occurrences of burglaries can help law enforcement allocate resources more efficiently and potentially reduce crime rates. The December analysis might reveal specific vulnerabilities or patterns that could inform the police to execute preventative measures during high-risk periods. Forecasting the next months allows police departments to prepare adequately, by increasing patrols or community alerts during expected peaks in criminal activity. Understanding these trends also assists in budget planning and resource allocation for community policing efforts. The data set for this question would include crime incident reports collected over time, enabling trend analysis and predictive modeling to forecast future occurrences based on historical data. This kind of analysis not only aids in immediate law enforcement response but also in long-term community safety strategies.

# Manipulations
One manipulation that we performed on the data was removing the time from the date/time column. There is a separate column for time already, and this was redundant data that was removed to improve readability. We did this by importing the data into excel, creating a separate column to clean the data, and performing the manipulation.

For one of our questions, we decided to forecast the quantity of specific crimes by month. In order to do this, we imported the data in excel to create a new column specifically for the month. With this new column, it allows us to more easily visualize our data and have a more readable data set. This would normally be a problem if the data spanned multiple years as the months in separate years would overlap, but the data is contained only within 2020, and the month of crime would not cross years.
